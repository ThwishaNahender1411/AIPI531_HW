# AIPI Homework 3: Session-Based DRL Recommenders

## Introduction
(TODO: Add a brief introduction about the project, its scope, and objectives.)

## Project Overview
This project is part of the AIPI Homework 3, focusing on the development and evaluation of session-based Deep Reinforcement Learning recommenders. The primary goal is to assess the impact of incorporating item features into these recommender systems, especially in the context of e-commerce applications.

## Methodology
(TODO: Elaborate on the methodology used in the project. This should include details about the data preprocessing steps, the DRL models implemented, and any specific techniques used for incorporating item features.)

## Results
(TODO: Provide a summary of the findings. This section should highlight how the inclusion of item features affected the performance of the DRL recommenders. Include any relevant statistics or graphs if available.)

## Conclusion
Successfully trained and compared session-based DRL recommenders with and without item features. The inclusion of item features significantly enhances the recommendation performance for e-commerce applications, demonstrating the value of incorporating additional item-level information into the recommendation process.
